                    Hi, I’m Hugo Jimenez Barrasa, a 19-year-old dreamer and game developer from the Canary Islands, Spain. 
                    My love story with game development began when I was just 7 years old. I wasn’t just playing games I 
                    was envisioning worlds, mechanics, and stories of my own. From that moment, I knew creating games wasn’t 
                    just a hobby for me; it was my calling.
                </p>
                <P>
                    Since then, I’ve dedicated myself to this craft, diving deep into game design and development with an 
                    insatiable curiosity. I’ve spent countless hours experimenting, learning, and bringing my own projects to life. 
                    Every challenge I’ve faced has fueled my determination, and every success has amplified my passion. 
                    Game development isn’t just what I do it’s who I am.
                </P>
                <p>
                    Currently, I’m pursuing a degree in IT at Inholland University of Applied Sciences in the Netherlands, 
                    where I’m building a strong foundation in programming, design, and technology. I’m committed to honing my craft 
                    and contributing to innovative, impactful projects that push the boundaries of what games can achieve.
