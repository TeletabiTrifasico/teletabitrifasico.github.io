        <p>Welcome to my software development portfolio. Here are some of the projects I've worked on:</p>

        <div class="project">
            <h2>Project 1: GameCriticCentral</h2>
            <p>
                In my first year at university, the first proyect I had to develop was a website using HTML and CSS. The site features 
                a homepage showcasing four of my favorite games, each accompanied by its trailer. Clicking on a game provides 
                access to images and an overview of the game. A navigation bar at the top allows users to switch between the 
                overview, a personal review enriched with images, and a short gameplay video.
            </p>

            <h2>Project 2: Someren</h2>
            <p>
                For my second project, I developed a C# application using Windows Forms for the front end and an Azure SQL database 
                for data management. This project required me to design a multi-layered application with a 4-layer architecture, 
                implementing database access through C# code.
            </p>
            <p>
                The application was created to manage a study trip to Someren, allowing students and lecturers to register, track 
                activities, and manage accommodations. It also included a drink stock system for a social event, handling transactions, 
                VAT calculations, and inventory management.
            </p>

        <div class="project">
            <h2>Project 3: PHP Webshop</h2>
            <p>
                For my third project, I developed a PHP-based webshop, my first project using PHP. The platform allows users to sell, 
                buy, and bid on rare items such as clocks, video games, and jewelry.
            </p>
            <p>
                The webshop includes features like user authentication, product listings, direct purchases, and bidding functionality 
                with a timer to track auction deadlines. Additionally, it implements a wallet system, ensuring users have sufficient 
                funds before placing bids. This project was my first project in which I used PHP, and it helped me a lot in learning 
                the language.

        <div class="project">
            <h2>Project 4: Garden Group</h2>    
            <p>
                For my fourth project, I worked on a ticketing system for Garden Group, developed in C# and XAML as part of a university 
                project. This application was designed to streamline issue tracking and support requests within an organization.
            </p>
            <p>
                The system allows users to log in securely with hashed password verification, submit new tickets with details such as title, 
                description, category, and priority, and view their submitted tickets, categorized by status. Each ticket includes a detailed 
                information view, making it easier to track and manage issues efficiently.
            </p>
            <p>
                This project strengthened my skills in C# application development, XAML UI design, and database management, providing a hands-on 
                experience in creating a functional and user-friendly system.

        <div class="project">
            <h2>Project 5: Haarlem Festival</h2>
            <p>
                For my fifth project, I have been working on Haarlem Festival, the most complex and ambitious project I have tackled so far. 
                This dynamic web application is designed to manage and showcase events and festivals in Haarlem, Netherlands, providing an 
                intuitive platform for both visitors and administrators.
            </p>
            <p>
                The application follows a modern tech stack, with a Vue.js 3 and TypeScript frontend that ensures a responsive, interactive 
                user experience, and a Laravel 11 backend integrated with MySQL for efficient data management. Using Inertia.js, the system 
                seamlessly connects the frontend and backend for a smooth, SPA-like navigation experience.
            </p>
            <h3>Key Features:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Festival Showcase: Displays upcoming festivals, event details, interactive schedules, and image galleries.</li>
                <li>Ticketing System: Allows users to purchase tickets for events through an integrated interface.</li>
                <li>Admin Dashboard: Enables CRUD operations for festivals, event scheduling, and user role management.</li>
                <li>CMS System: Includes a rich-text editor, content versioning, and a hierarchical content structure.</li>
                <li>Security & Authentication: Implements role-based access control, CSRF protection, and secure password hashing.</li>
            </ul>
            <P>
                This project has significantly enhanced my expertise in modern JavaScript frameworks (Vue.js 3, TypeScript), Laravel backend 
                development, database design, security implementation, and frontend-backend integration. It has been an incredible learning 
                experience, allowing me to develop a scalable, feature-rich web application that meets real-world event management needs.
            </P>
