        <p>Welcome to my software development portfolio. Here are some of the projects I've worked on:</p>

        <div class="project">
            <h2>Project 1: Chapeau</h2>
            <p>
                Chapeau is a desktop application I built as part of a team project to manage the full operations of a restaurant. 
                It’s developed in C# using .NET 8.0 and Windows Forms, and it handles everything from taking orders and tracking stock 
                to managing staff roles. One of the best things about the project is how each type of employee waiter, bar staff, 
                kitchen, or manager gets their own custom interface and access level. It really helped us think through how different 
                roles interact with the system in a real restaurant setting.
            </p>
            <p>
                On the technical side, the app is structured using a layered architecture. We kept the logic clean by separating the 
                code into different projects for models, data access (DAL), services, and UI. Everything is backed by a SQL Server database, 
                which keeps track of orders, inventory, employees, and more. This project really helped me get comfortable with building 
                larger-scale desktop apps, structuring code in a maintainable way, and thinking like a developer working on real business software.

            <h2>Project 2: PHP Webshop</h2>
            <h3>Version 1</h3>
            <p>
                For my second project, I developed a classic PHP-based webshop, my first project using PHP. 
                This platform allows users to sell or buy rare items such as clocks, video games, and jewelry. 
                It features user authentication, product listings and direct purchases. This project was a major 
                step in learning PHP and understanding how to build dynamic, user-driven web applications from scratch.
            </p>

            <h3>Version 2</h3>
            <p>
                Building on my experience, I created a second version of the webshop with a more modern, professional stack. 
                This version uses a PHP 8 backend connected to a Vue.js 3 frontend and a MySQL 8 database, all running 
                inside Docker containers. The platform includes real-time shopping cart management, a full checkout process 
                with order confirmation, user authentication through JWT tokens, and a role-based access system for users 
                and admins. Admins can manage products, users, and orders via a dedicated dashboard, while users can browse 
                products with detailed views and upload images for listings. The webshop is fully responsive, offering an 
                optimized experience across mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.

            <h2>Project 3: Garden Group</h2>    
            <p>
                For my third project, I worked on a ticketing system for Garden Group, developed in C# and XAML as part of a university 
                project. This application was designed to streamline issue tracking and support requests within an organization.
            </p>
            <p>
                The system allows users to log in securely with hashed password verification, submit new tickets with details such as title, 
                description, category, and priority, and view their submitted tickets, categorized by status. Each ticket includes a detailed 
                information view, making it easier to track and manage issues efficiently.
            </p>
            <p>
                This project strengthened my skills in C# application development, XAML UI design, and database management, providing a hands-on 
                experience in creating a functional and user-friendly system.

            <h2>Project 4: Haarlem Festival</h2>
            <p>
                For my fourth project, I have been working on Haarlem Festival, the most complex and ambitious project I have tackled so far. 
                This dynamic web application is designed to manage and showcase events and festivals in Haarlem, Netherlands, providing an 
                intuitive platform for both visitors and administrators.
            </p>
            <p>
                The application follows a modern tech stack, with a Vue.js 3 and TypeScript frontend that ensures a responsive, interactive 
                user experience, and a Laravel 11 backend integrated with MySQL for efficient data management. Using Inertia.js, the system 
                seamlessly connects the frontend and backend for a smooth, SPA-like navigation experience.
            </p>
            <h3>Key Features:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Festival Showcase: Displays upcoming festivals, event details, interactive schedules, and image galleries.</li>
                <li>Ticketing System: Allows users to purchase tickets for events through an integrated interface.</li>
                <li>Admin Dashboard: Enables CRUD operations for festivals, event scheduling, and user role management.</li>
                <li>CMS System: Includes a rich-text editor, content versioning, and a hierarchical content structure.</li>
                <li>Security & Authentication: Implements role-based access control, CSRF protection, and secure password hashing.</li>
            </ul>
            <P>
                This project has significantly enhanced my expertise in modern JavaScript frameworks (Vue.js 3, TypeScript), Laravel backend 
                development, database design, security implementation, and frontend-backend integration. It has been an incredible learning 
                experience, allowing me to develop a scalable, feature-rich web application that meets real-world event management needs.

            <h2>Project 5: Code Generation</h2>
            <p>
                For my fifth project, I collaborated in a team of four to develop a banking application consisting of a full REST API 
                and a frontend interface. The backend was built using Java and the Spring Boot framework, with the API documented 
                and accessible through Swagger UI. We started by designing a complete API specification with OpenAPI, which served 
                as the foundation for development.
            </p>
            <p>
                The application supports core banking functionalities and is secured with JWT-based authentication. It includes full 
                unit testing (Java) and functional testing using Cucumber, aiming for high code quality and 90%+ test coverage. The 
                frontend, built with Vue.js, connects seamlessly to the API and is fully responsive across devices. The entire system 
                was deployed and hosted publicly using containerized environments.
            </p>
            <p>
                This project strengthened my skills in backend development with Java, API-first design, frontend integration, 
                and professional software development practices like testing, containerization, and CI/CD pipelines.
